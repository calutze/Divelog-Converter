We followed the reef wall for most of the dive riding the current to the point of the island. I saw a very large rainbow parrot fish and 2 large barracudas. There were very large barrel sponges that I could have fit into. Texas itself was a Sandy patch with very large barrel sponges that looked a bit like tumbleweeds or saguaros. My favorite dive so far.

The sharks we're already starting to swim around and investigate. There were some groupers that were quite large ~40-50 lb and 2-3 feet long. They would swim right up to you and I pet a few of them. We swam with the sharks in the current for a few minutes and then the divemaster opened a bucket of fish which they fed from. They were very excited and the feeding was over in ~40 seconds. Then we swam a bit and looked for sharks teeth but didn't find any before ascending along the mooring line to the boat. We completed a safety stop for 3 minutes at 20 feet then climbed aboard the boat one at a time.",
